# Skynest

**Your team's knowledge, always available.**

Skynest brings [Context Nest](https://github.com/PromptOwl/ContextNest) to the cloud — a hosted MCP server your whole team can connect to from any AI tool, anywhere, without running anything locally.

---

## What is Skynest?

### Built on Context Nest

[Context Nest](https://github.com/PromptOwl/ContextNest) (by [PromptOwl](https://promptowl.ai)) is a structured knowledge vault for AI tools. Rather than dumping raw files at an AI, it organizes information as interconnected documents — nodes with graph relationships, pack bundles, semantic indexing, and full version history — purpose-built for AI consumption. Teams use it to share meeting notes, project decisions, architectural context, and reference documentation directly with Claude, Cursor, and other AI tools through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

### The limitation: it's tied to your machine

The original Context Nest runs as a local stdio MCP server with vault files on your filesystem. That means it only works when your machine is on and the server process is running. Sharing the vault via OneDrive or Dropbox can extend access to teammates, but requires every person to have the right drive mapped and synced — and there's no built-in multi-user story. Writes from different people can conflict silently, and nothing links a document change to the person who made it.

### What Skynest adds: cloud deployment

Skynest adapts Context Nest for serverless cloud deployment on Vercel. It replaces the local filesystem with **Vercel Blob** — durable, globally accessible object storage — so vault documents are always available without any local process running. Authentication is handled by **GitHub OAuth 2.1**: every team member signs in with their own GitHub account, and every write is committed to a private GitHub repository under that user's identity. You get a complete, accurate audit trail of who wrote what and when, using real git commits — not a synthetic log.

All 19 Context Nest MCP tools — `read_document`, `search`, `create_document`, `update_document`, `read_version`, integrity checks, and more — are exposed over HTTPS. Connect once from Claude Code, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible AI tool, and your team's entire knowledge vault is immediately accessible from any machine, any time.

> Skynest is built on the open-source Context Nest engine by PromptOwl (AGPL-3.0). The vault storage layer has been adapted to run on Vercel's serverless infrastructure, with GitHub OAuth and Vercel Blob replacing the local filesystem.

## Features

| | |
|---|---|
| **Always on** | Deployed to the Cloud — your vault is reachable over HTTPS 24/7, not just when your computer is open. |
| **Multi-user** | Every team member signs in with their own GitHub account. Writes are committed with native git attribution. |
| **Git-versioned** | Every document change is a real commit in a private GitHub repository — full history, diffs, and rollback. |
| **read.ai integration** | Meeting transcripts are automatically ingested into the vault when a meeting ends — no manual action needed. |

---

## How it works

1. Sign in with your GitHub account when prompted by your AI tool.
2. Skynest authenticates you via OAuth and issues a secure session token.
3. Your AI tool can now read, search, create, and update vault documents over MCP.
4. Every write is committed to the vault repo under your GitHub identity.

## Deploying Skynest

### Prerequisites

- A [Vercel](https://vercel.com) account
- A [GitHub](https://github.com) account (for OAuth App registration and vault repo)
- `pnpm` >= 9, Node.js >= 20
- An existing Context Nest vault (or a new one initialized with the `ctx` CLI)

### 1. Create the vault repository

Push your existing vault to a new **private** GitHub repository, or create an empty one and initialize it later. This repo (`<owner>/contextnest-vault`) becomes the source of truth for version history.

```bash
# From your local vault directory
bash scripts/init-vault.sh <local-vault-path>
```

Add each team member as a collaborator on the vault repository.

### 2. Register a GitHub OAuth App

Go to **GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → OAuth Apps → New OAuth App** and fill in:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Application name | Skynest |
| Homepage URL | `https://<your-vercel-app>.vercel.app` |
| Authorization callback URL | `https://<your-vercel-app>.vercel.app/api/auth/callback/github` |

Note the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** — you'll need them in the next step.

### 3. Generate OAuth signing keys

```bash
pnpm oauth:gen-keypair
```

This outputs `OAUTH_JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` and `OAUTH_JWT_PUBLIC_KEY` values for your environment.

### 4. Deploy to Vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/jhs129/skynest)

> If you're deploying from a fork, update the `repository-url` query param above to point at your own org/repo before sharing this button.

Or deploy via the CLI:

```bash
pnpm dlx vercel
```

### 5. Set environment variables

In the Vercel project dashboard (**Settings → Environment Variables**), add the following:

```bash
# GitHub OAuth App (for user sign-in)
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<your-github-oauth-client-id>
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-github-oauth-client-secret>

# NextAuth
AUTH_SECRET=<random-32-char-string>    # openssl rand -base64 32
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://<your-vercel-app>.vercel.app

# OAuth JWT signing (from step 3)
OAUTH_JWT_PRIVATE_KEY=<generated-private-key>
OAUTH_JWT_PUBLIC_KEY=<generated-public-key>

# Storage backend
CONTEXTNEST_STORAGE=blob
CONTEXTNEST_BLOB_PREFIX=vault     # namespace prefix for Blob objects

# Vercel Blob (auto-populated when you connect a Blob store in step 6)
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=<vercel-blob-token>

# Vault GitHub sync — single "owner/repo" string
VAULT_REPO=<github-username-or-org>/contextnest-vault
VAULT_BRANCH=main                  # optional, defaults to main
VAULT_SYNC_PROVIDER=github         # 'github' (default) or 'none' to disable

# Authorization — which identity mode gates mcp:read / mcp:write scope
AUTH_PROVIDER=github               # 'github' (default) or 'entra'

# Required when AUTH_PROVIDER=github (usually the same repo as VAULT_REPO)
AUTHZ_GITHUB_REPO=<github-username-or-org>/contextnest-vault

# Required when AUTH_PROVIDER=entra — sign-in via Microsoft Entra ID
ENTRA_TENANT_ID=<entra-tenant-id>
ENTRA_CLIENT_ID=<entra-app-client-id>
ENTRA_CLIENT_SECRET=<entra-app-client-secret>
AUTHZ_ENTRA_WRITE_GROUP_ID=<group-id>[,<group-id>...]  # members get mcp:read + mcp:write (comma-separated for multiple groups)
AUTHZ_ENTRA_READ_GROUP_ID=<group-id>[,<group-id>...]   # members get mcp:read only (comma-separated for multiple groups)

# Optional — also accept tokens issued directly by a trusted Entra tenant
# (e.g. from an MCP client's own on-behalf-of flow), alongside Skynest's own
# self-issued OAuth tokens. Leave both unset to keep today's self-issued-only
# behavior exactly as-is.
MCP_TRUSTED_ISSUER=https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-guid>/v2.0
MCP_TRUSTED_AUDIENCE=api://<skynest-entra-app-id>   # from that app registration's "Expose an API" Identifier URI
# (no env var needed for GitHub-mode headless agents — see "Headless agents" below)

# read.ai webhook (optional — only needed if using the webhook integration)
WEBHOOK_API_KEY=<secret-key>       # included in the webhook URL path
READ_AI_SIGNING_KEY=<hmac-key>     # from the read.ai dashboard
BOT_GITHUB_TOKEN=<github-pat>      # PAT with repo scope, for bot vault writes
```

### 6. Provision Vercel Blob

In the Vercel project dashboard, go to **Storage → Connect Store** and create or attach a Blob store. The `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` will be added automatically.

### 7. Redeploy and verify

Trigger a fresh deployment. Visit your Vercel URL — you should see the Skynest home page. The MCP endpoint is live at `https://<your-vercel-app>.vercel.app/api/mcp`.

---

## Connecting your AI tool

### Prerequisites

- A **GitHub account** — Skynest uses GitHub OAuth for authentication. You'll be prompted to authorize on first connection.
- **Vault access** — ask your Skynest admin to add your GitHub username as a collaborator on the vault repository.

Replace `YOUR_SKYNEST_URL` below with your actual deployment URL.

### Claude Code CLI

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http skynest https://YOUR_SKYNEST_URL/api/mcp
```

Restart Claude Code. On first use you'll be prompted to sign in with GitHub.

<details>
<summary>Manual config alternative</summary>

Add to `~/.claude/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "skynest": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://YOUR_SKYNEST_URL/api/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

### Claude Code App (Desktop)

1. Open Claude Code and go to **Settings**.
2. Navigate to **MCP Servers** and click **Add Server**.
3. Enter:
   ```
   Name:      skynest
   Transport: HTTP
   URL:       https://YOUR_SKYNEST_URL/api/mcp
   ```
4. Save and restart. You'll be prompted to sign in with GitHub on first use.

### Cursor

Add to your project's `.cursor/mcp.json` (or the global Cursor MCP config):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "skynest": {
      "url": "https://YOUR_SKYNEST_URL/api/mcp",
      "transport": "http"
    }
  }
}
```

Reload Cursor. On first use, a browser window will open for GitHub OAuth sign-in.

### Other MCP-compatible tools

Skynest exposes a standard MCP HTTP endpoint with OAuth 2.1. Any tool that supports MCP over HTTP with OAuth 2.1 should work — use `https://YOUR_SKYNEST_URL/api/mcp` as the endpoint.

### Headless agents (no browser, no interactive login)

A deployed agent that can't do the interactive GitHub OAuth flow can still call the MCP endpoint directly, using its own credential as the bearer token — no separate secret or config needed:

- **`AUTH_PROVIDER=github` instances**: present a real GitHub PAT (fine-grained, scoped to the vault repo) as the bearer token. Skynest checks that PAT's actual push/pull access on `AUTHZ_GITHUB_REPO` live against the GitHub API — the same check an interactive user's token gets — and, if it has access, uses that same token to attribute and commit its own vault writes. There's nothing to configure beyond giving the agent's GitHub identity collaborator access to the repo, same as any human user.
- **`AUTH_PROVIDER=entra` instances**: register the agent as its own Entra app (or use an existing one) and have it mint a token via the client-credentials grant, then set `MCP_TRUSTED_ISSUER`/`MCP_TRUSTED_AUDIENCE` (see above) so that token is accepted. Put the app in one of the configured `AUTHZ_ENTRA_*_GROUP_ID` groups (or grant it an app role your authorization check recognizes) for read/write access.

## Vault-hosted skills

A vault can carry its own instructions for use. Save a `type: skill` node — `create_document`
accepts `trigger`, `tools_required` and `output_format` — and any connected agent can fetch it
and install a local loader in one step.

**Designate an entry point** in `.context/config.yaml` so an agent with no prior knowledge can
ask "how do I use this vault?" and get the right node. `vault_info` reports it.

```yaml
skills:
  bootstrap: nodes/skills/vault-bootstrap
```

**Install it.** `get_skill_install_manifest` returns file contents and intended paths; the
*calling agent* writes them, because this server is remote and has no filesystem access.

```
get_skill_install_manifest({ path: "nodes/skills/vault-bootstrap", server_alias: "skynest" })
```

Two things are worth knowing:

- **`mode` defaults to `loader`.** The installed file carries the node's `skill.trigger` (as the
  harness `description`, which is what decides whether the skill fires) plus an instruction to
  fetch the procedure at run time — not the procedure itself. A local copy of a procedure drifts
  the moment the node is updated, and the drift is invisible: the agent keeps working,
  confidently, from superseded rules. `mode: "full"` inlines a snapshot for offline use and is a
  deliberate choice.
- **Pass `server_alias`.** The tool prefix is client-side configuration, not a server fact — the
  same vault is `mcp__skynest__*` on one machine and `mcp__bigearnie-ctx__*` on another. It
  defaults to the vault id. Node bodies should write `{{server_alias}}`, `{{vault_id}}` and
  `{{node_path}}` rather than hardcoding a prefix; those are resolved per caller at render time.

`get_skill` returns the same node rendered for a harness (`claude-code`, `cursor`, `codex`, or
`raw`) without the install wrapper.

---

## read.ai Webhook

Skynest can automatically ingest meeting transcripts from [read.ai](https://read.ai) when a meeting ends. Configure the webhook in your read.ai workspace settings:

**Webhook URL:**
```
https://YOUR_SKYNEST_URL/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_API_KEY/default/readai
```

Replace `YOUR_WEBHOOK_API_KEY` with the value you set in the `WEBHOOK_API_KEY` environment variable. Replace `default` with your vault ID if you're using a named vault.

Set the **signing key** in read.ai to the value you set in `READ_AI_SIGNING_KEY`.

When a meeting ends, read.ai POSTs the transcript to Skynest, which:
1. Verifies the HMAC signature
2. Deduplicates by `request_id`
3. Uses Claude Haiku to classify the meeting (client, tags, summary, action items)
4. Writes a structured node to `nodes/meetings/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`
5. Commits the file to the vault repo via the bot GitHub token

---

## Local development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build the vendored engine
pnpm --filter @promptowl/contextnest-engine build

# Copy .env.example and fill in values
cp .env.example .env.local

# Start the dev server
pnpm dev
```

The app runs at `http://localhost:3000`. The MCP endpoint is at `http://localhost:3000/api/mcp`.

For local development, set `CONTEXTNEST_STORAGE=fs` and `CONTEXTNEST_VAULT_PATH=/path/to/your/vault` to use a local filesystem vault instead of Vercel Blob. Set `VAULT_SYNC_PROVIDER=none` to disable git sync.
